1.Adjust scripts and files V
  -Rebuild scream dataset removing silences V
  -Edit config V
  -Remove preprocess V

2. Implement Generator V
  -Same architecture of MelGAN V
  -Use Kapre to get Mel V
  -Input and Output = 22050 samples (1 second) V
  -[Try with weight normalization] V

3. Implement Discriminator(s) V
  -Same architecture of MelGAN V
  -Unbounded score as output of each discriminator V
  -[Try with weight normalization] V

4. Implement Loader V
  -Use librosa to load data when needed V
  -Load BATCH_SIZE random 1 second segments (Window-based) V
  -Pad if necessary V
  -Load both whispers for generation and screams for discrimination V
  -[Try remove silences whispers]
  -[Try with librosa's normalization] V
  -[Try with amplitude augmenting]
  -[Try to add Gaussian noise]

5. Implement Train loop V
  -Train generator and discriminator asynchronously at each train step V
  -Use main losses from MelGAN V
  -Use correlation loss ([try with correlation between mels, or other losses, if needed]) V
  -Pass all generated samples to the discriminator, as well as a same number of screams V

6. Training V
  -Implement Trainer V
  -Save weights checkpoints V
  -Save samples of tests V

7. Test V
  -Fix compile errors V
  -Fix runtime errors V
  -Run trainings and fix until it works V
  -[It may be necessary to train using more recordings and with different speakers]

8. Refinements V
  -Make weight normalization work V
  -Add preprocessing normalization in network V
  -Run TFLite conversion V

9. Implement on Android Studio
