1.Adjust scripts and files
  -Rebuild scream dataset removing silences V
  -Edit config V
  -Remove preprocess V

2. Implement Generator
  -Same architecture of MelGAN
  -Use Kepra to get Mel
  -Input and Output = 22050 samples (1 second)
  -[Try with weight normalization]

3. Implement Discriminator(s)
  -Same architecture of MelGAN
  -Unbounded score as output of each discriminator
  -[Try with weight normalization]

4. Implement Loader
  -Use librosa to load data when needed
  -Remove silences
  -Load BATCH_SIZE random 1 second segments (Window-based)
  -Pad if necessary
  -Load both whispers for generation and screams for discrimination
  -[Try with librosa's normalization]
  -[Try with amplitude augmenting]
  -[Try to add Gaussian noise]

5. Implement Train loop
  -Train generator and discriminator asynchronously at each train step
  -Use main losses from MelGAN
  -Use correlation loss ([try with correlation between mels, or other losses, if needed])
  -Pass all generated samples to the discriminator, as well as a same number of screams

6. Convert to TFLite

7. Test
  -It may be necessary to train using more recordings and with different speakers
